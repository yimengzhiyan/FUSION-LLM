Location: Chromosome 'Chr4', from position '10,763,206' to '10,765,795'
Full name: 'class V chitinase'
Function: 'ChiC encodes a Class V chitinase that is a part of glycoside hydrolase family 18 based on CAZy groupings. It appears to primarily act as an exochitinase in vitro where it predominantly cleaves a chitobiose (GlcNAc)2 residue from the non-reducing end of a chitin oligosaccharide. However, it shows some minor endochitinase activity in vitro, as well. A putative 24 amino-acid signal peptide may direct this protein to the secretory system and it has been detected in cell wall apoplastic fluid. RT-PCR experiments demonstrate that ChiC transcript levels are increased in response to abscisisc acid, jasmonic acid, and NaCl stress. Microarray results also suggest that transcript levels rise in response to osmotic stress, two fungal pathogens, a bacterial pathogen, and the elicitor flagellin.The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.'

Function: 'IBM1 likely encodes a protein with histone H3mK9 demethylation activity. It may preferentially demethylate H3mK9 at low-copy loci to protect them from silencing by nearby heterochromatin by preventing the spread of cytosine methylation. BONSAI (At1g73177) is hypermethylated in ibm1 mutants. ibm1 mutants have morphological defects that become apparent at the F3 generation, including small narrow leaves, arrested flower development, and faulty pollen development. These phenotypes cannot result solely from the BONSAI hypermethylation. Aberrant phenotypes in ibm1 mutants in both DNA methylation and plant development can be suppressed by mutations in the KYP H3K9 methyltransferase or the CMT3 non CG-cytosine methylase.'

Function: 'Encodes a chloroplast-localized hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate (HMBPP) synthase (HDS), catalyzes the formation of HMBPP from 2-C-methyl-D-erythrytol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate (MEcPP). The HDS enzyme controls the penultimate steps of the biosynthesis of IPP and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) via the MEP pathway and may serve as a metabolic control point for SA-mediated disease resistance. In the light, the electrons required for the reaction catalyzed by HDS are directly provided by the electron flow from photosynthesis via ferredoxin. In the dark however, the enzyme requires an electron shuttle: ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase.The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.'

Through its action on the regulation of ARF17 expression, the protein regulates genes involved at the cross talk between auxin and light signaling during adventitious root development. AGO1 seems to be targeted for degradation by silencing suppressor F-box-containing proteins from Turnip yellow virus and Cucurbit aphid-borne yellow virus.'

Knockouts of CAP1 produced more cytoplasmic NH4+ and ceased growth of root hairs on MS medium except when NH4+ was depleted; NH4+ depletion reestablished the Ca2+ gradient necessary for normal growth. The lower net NH4+ influx across the vacuolar membrane and relatively alkaline cytosolic pH of root hairs in cap1-1 relative to wild type implied that mutation of CAP1 results in more NH4+ accumulation in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, CAP1 functionally complemented npr1 kinase yeast mutant defective in high-affinity NH4+ uptake via MEP2, distinguishing CAP1 as a cytosolic modulator of NH4+ level that participates in NH4+ homeostasis-regulated root hair growth by modulating tip-focused cytoplasmic Ca2+ gradients.'

Full name: 'ARABIDOPSIS PEROXIN 5,EMBRYO DEFECTIVE 2790,peroxin 5'
Function: 'Encodes the peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 receptor that facilitates peroxisomal protein translocation. It recognizes proteins with the PTS1 consensus sequence (tripeptide SKL or a conserved variant) at the extreme C terminus. The protein has several domains, including C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat motifs which act in binding the C-terminal "SKL" targeting signal. The mechanism of transport has been worked out in other organisms: The receptor recognizes and binds cytosolic PTS1-containing proteins. The PEX5-PTS1 complex binds a PEX14/PEX13 receptor complex at the peroxisome membrane and is translocated into the peroxisome matrix in a process dependent on PEX2,PEX10, and PEX12. In the peroxisome matrix, PEX5 releases its cargo and is recycled to the cytosol in a process dependent on PEX1, PEX4, PEX6 and PEX22. It is also involved, in conjunction with PEX7, in PTS1- and PTS2-dependent peroxisomal protein import. RNAi experiments suggest that PEX5 is necessary for the maintenance of both glyoxysomal and leaf peroxisomal functions.'

Function: 'Encodes a 645-amino acid methylcytosine-binding protein with a PHD domain, two RING finger domains, and an SRA domain that is involved in centromere heterochromatinization. This protein functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in vitro. The protein has been shown to bind to methylated cytosines of CG, CNG and CNN motifs via its SRA domain but has a preference for the former. It plays a role in the establishment/maintenance of chromatin structure during cell division and is localized in the nucleus. Plants over-expressing VIM1/ORTH2 show an inhibition in root growth and a delay in flowering. Both over-expression of GFP:ORTH2 and loss of ORTH2/VIM1 lead to decreased levels of DNA methylation. GFP:ORTH2 over-expressers also have increased levels of FWA transcripts.'

Negative regulator of the response to GA in controlling seed germination. GA triggers the degradation of RGL2 protein in a process blocked by both proteasome inhibitors and serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors. The protein undergoes degradation in response to GA via the 26S proteasome. RGL2 may be involved in reducing ROS accumulation in response to stress by up-regulating the transcription of superoxide dismutases. Rapidly degraded in response to GA. Regulates GA-promoted seed germination. Involved in flower and fruit development.'

Function: 'IBM1 likely encodes a protein with histone H3mK9 demethylation activity. It may preferentially demethylate H3mK9 at low-copy loci to protect them from silencing by nearby heterochromatin by preventing the spread of cytosine methylation. BONSAI (At1g73177) is hypermethylated in ibm1 mutants. ibm1 mutants have morphological defects that become apparent at the F3 generation, including small narrow leaves, arrested flower development, and faulty pollen development. These phenotypes cannot result solely from the BONSAI hypermethylation. Aberrant phenotypes in ibm1 mutants in both DNA methylation and plant development can be suppressed by mutations in the KYP H3K9 methyltransferase or the CMT3 non CG-cytosine methylase.'

The leaf laminas were asymmetric and narrow because of a severely reduced cell number. TRN1 is required for the maintenance of both the radial pattern of tissue differentiation in the root and for the subsequent circumferential pattern within the epidermis. Double mutant analysis showed that TRN1 and TRN2 act in the same pathway.'

Function: 'Encodes a SWI/SWF nuclear-localized chromatin remodeling factor of the CHD3 group. Involved in post-germination repression of embryonic development. Acts with GA to establish repression of embryonic genes upon germination. Protein preferentially accumulates in differentiating tissues. Loss of function alleles are associated with expression of embryonic traits in adult plants and derepression of embryonic genes such as PHEROS1. Is an extragenic suppressor of slr2 (SSL2). Mutations in PKL (SSL2) restores lateral root formation in the slr2 mutant slr-1. It was proposed that PKL/SSL2-mediated chromatin remodeling negatively regulates auxin-mediated LR formation in Arabidopsis.The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile. Regulates plant responses to cold and salt stress.'

Full name: 'BR INSENSITIVE 1,BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1,CABBAGE 2,DWARF 2'
Function: 'Encodes a plasma membrane localized leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase involved in brassinosteroid signal transduction. BRI1 ligand is brassinolide which binds at the extracellular domain. Binding results in phosphorylation of the kinase domain which activates the BRI1 protein leading to BR responses. Residue T-1049 and either S-1044 or T-1045 were essential for kinase function in vitro and normal BRI1 signaling in planta. The structure of BRI1 ligand-binding domain has been determined at 2.5A resolution. Although BAK1 and BRI1 alone localize in the plasma membrane, when BAK1 and BRI1 are coexpressed, the heterodimer BAK1/BRI1 they form is localized in the endosome. BRI1 appears to be involved in the autonomous pathway that regulates the transition to flowering, primarily through its effects on FLC expression levels, as uncovered by double mutant analyses. This most likely occurs as a result of BRI1-dependent effects on histone acetylation, but not histone triMeH3K4 methylation, at the FLC locus. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.'

Full name: 'FAR1-RELATED SEQUENCES-RELATED FACTOR1'
Function: 'Encodes one of four FRS (FAR1-RELATED SEQUENCE) factor-like genes in Arabidopsis. FRS factors are characterized by having an N-terminal C2H2-type chelating motif of the WRKY- Glial Cell Missing1 family, a central core transposase domain of Mutator-like element transposases, and a C-terminal SWIM domain. The four FRF-like genes in Arabidopsis share only the N-terminal motif with FRS proteins. FRF1 has been shown to bind the RB-box in vitro. The RB-box contributes to restricting SHOOTMERISTEMLESS expression to the shoot apical meristem.'

Full name: 'BR INSENSITIVE 1,BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1,CABBAGE 2,DWARF 2'
Function: 'Encodes a plasma membrane localized leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase involved in brassinosteroid signal transduction. BRI1 ligand is brassinolide which binds at the extracellular domain. Binding results in phosphorylation of the kinase domain which activates the BRI1 protein leading to BR responses. Residue T-1049 and either S-1044 or T-1045 were essential for kinase function in vitro and normal BRI1 signaling in planta. The structure of BRI1 ligand-binding domain has been determined at 2.5A resolution. Although BAK1 and BRI1 alone localize in the plasma membrane, when BAK1 and BRI1 are coexpressed, the heterodimer BAK1/BRI1 they form is localized in the endosome. BRI1 appears to be involved in the autonomous pathway that regulates the transition to flowering, primarily through its effects on FLC expression levels, as uncovered by double mutant analyses. This most likely occurs as a result of BRI1-dependent effects on histone acetylation, but not histone triMeH3K4 methylation, at the FLC locus. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.'

Location: Chromosome 'Chr1', from position '9,393,653' to '9,394,716'
Full name: '-'
Function: 'Encodes a protein with a RNA recognition motif. Previously annotated as ATHB54, a homeodomain leucine zipper (HD-Zip) family protein. In the TAIR10 genome release (2010), this locus was split into two loci: AT1G27045 (containing homeodomain and leucine zipper domains) and AT1G27050 (containing a RNA recognition motif). AT1G27045 is now named ATHB54. Note that Affymetrix ATH1 Probe Set linked to symbol ATHB54 is in fact directed against the product of the AT1G27050 locus (the mRNA coding for the RNA-recognition-motif protein).'

It appears to primarily act as an exochitinase in vitro where it predominantly cleaves a chitobiose (GlcNAc)2 residue from the non-reducing end of a chitin oligosaccharide. However, it shows some minor endochitinase activity in vitro, as well. A putative 24 amino-acid signal peptide may direct this protein to the secretory system and it has been detected in cell wall apoplastic fluid. RT-PCR experiments demonstrate that ChiC transcript levels are increased in response to abscisisc acid, jasmonic acid, and NaCl stress. Microarray results also suggest that transcript levels rise in response to osmotic stress, two fungal pathogens, a bacterial pathogen, and the elicitor flagellin.The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.'

Full name: 'cryptochrome 2,cryptochrome 2'
Function: 'Blue light receptor mediating blue-light regulated cotyledon expansion and flowering time. Positive regulator of the flowering-time gene CONSTANS. This gene possesses a light-induced CNT2 N-terminal homodimerisation domain.Involved in blue-light induced stomatal opening. Involved in triggering chromatin decondensation. An 80-residue motif (NC80) is sufficient to confer CRY2's physiological function. It is proposed that the PHR domain and the C-terminal tail of the unphosphorylated CRY2 form a "closed" conformation to suppress the NC80 motif in the absence of light. In response to blue light, the C-terminal tail of CRY2 is phosphorylated and electrostatically repelled from the surface of the PHR domain to form an "open" conformation, resulting in derepression of the NC80 motif and signal transduction to trigger photomorphogenic responses. Cry2 phosphorylation and degradation both occur in the nucleus.The life-time of cry2 signaling state in situ (in planta) is about 16 min.'

It has been identified as a suppressor of Bax-induced cell death by functional screening in yeast and can also suppress Bax-induced cell death in tobacco plants. Overexpression of this gene in tobacco BY-2 cells confers resistance to H2O2 and heat stresses. Overexpression in Arabidopsis causes upregulation of PDF1.2 and GST6. It is part of the ethylene signaling pathway and is predicted to act downstream of EIN2 and CTR1, but not under EIN3. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.'

Full name: 'BR INSENSITIVE 1,BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1,CABBAGE 2,DWARF 2'
Function: 'Encodes a plasma membrane localized leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase involved in brassinosteroid signal transduction. BRI1 ligand is brassinolide which binds at the extracellular domain. Binding results in phosphorylation of the kinase domain which activates the BRI1 protein leading to BR responses. Residue T-1049 and either S-1044 or T-1045 were essential for kinase function in vitro and normal BRI1 signaling in planta. The structure of BRI1 ligand-binding domain has been determined at 2.5A resolution. Although BAK1 and BRI1 alone localize in the plasma membrane, when BAK1 and BRI1 are coexpressed, the heterodimer BAK1/BRI1 they form is localized in the endosome. BRI1 appears to be involved in the autonomous pathway that regulates the transition to flowering, primarily through its effects on FLC expression levels, as uncovered by double mutant analyses. This most likely occurs as a result of BRI1-dependent effects on histone acetylation, but not histone triMeH3K4 methylation, at the FLC locus. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.'

Full name: 'BR INSENSITIVE 1,BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1,CABBAGE 2,DWARF 2'
Function: 'Encodes a plasma membrane localized leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase involved in brassinosteroid signal transduction. BRI1 ligand is brassinolide which binds at the extracellular domain. Binding results in phosphorylation of the kinase domain which activates the BRI1 protein leading to BR responses. Residue T-1049 and either S-1044 or T-1045 were essential for kinase function in vitro and normal BRI1 signaling in planta. The structure of BRI1 ligand-binding domain has been determined at 2.5A resolution. Although BAK1 and BRI1 alone localize in the plasma membrane, when BAK1 and BRI1 are coexpressed, the heterodimer BAK1/BRI1 they form is localized in the endosome. BRI1 appears to be involved in the autonomous pathway that regulates the transition to flowering, primarily through its effects on FLC expression levels, as uncovered by double mutant analyses. This most likely occurs as a result of BRI1-dependent effects on histone acetylation, but not histone triMeH3K4 methylation, at the FLC locus. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.'

CEP1 was also released to the tapetal cell wall during late stage 6 and stage 7. After the tapetal cell wall degenerated, the CEP1 enzyme entered the callose wall from the degenerated tapetal cell wall and was probably involved in degeneration of the callose wall.'

Function: 'ChiC encodes a Class V chitinase that is a part of glycoside hydrolase family 18 based on CAZy groupings. It appears to primarily act as an exochitinase in vitro where it predominantly cleaves a chitobiose (GlcNAc)2 residue from the non-reducing end of a chitin oligosaccharide. However, it shows some minor endochitinase activity in vitro, as well. A putative 24 amino-acid signal peptide may direct this protein to the secretory system and it has been detected in cell wall apoplastic fluid. RT-PCR experiments demonstrate that ChiC transcript levels are increased in response to abscisisc acid, jasmonic acid, and NaCl stress. Microarray results also suggest that transcript levels rise in response to osmotic stress, two fungal pathogens, a bacterial pathogen, and the elicitor flagellin.The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.'
